# Full-Stack
### This respository contains with basic frondent with hmtl and mainly using SQLite as the backend. The purpose of this program is to learn about the big picture of the Full-Stack Development, manipulate data back and forth between client, server, and database.
#### I learned how to use do_get and do_post to interact with the server and the database.

Note: I personally think it is easier to use HTML, JS, and CSS as the frond-end and use Python and SQLite as the Backend. I used Python to construct the frond-end in this project, and it was really confusing.
